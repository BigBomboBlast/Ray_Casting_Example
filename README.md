# Ray_Casting_Example
UNFINISHED, I WILL MAYBE REWRITE MANY OF THIS CODE SOME DAY

NOTE: THIS ENTIRE THING WAS WRITTEN PAINFULLY WITH ONLY USING WINAPI
SERIOUSLY, I DONT EVEN INCLUDE BASIC MATH LIBRARIES. THIS IS TRUE MASOCHISTIC GAME DEV
MAINLY JUST EXISTS AS A REFERENCE FOR ME TO GET THINGS SET UP WHEN MAKING NEW PROJECTS
ONE DAY I WILL FIGURE OUT RAYCASTING, BUT AS OF RIGHT NOW I AM TOO TIRED
